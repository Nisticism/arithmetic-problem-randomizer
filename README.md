The app randomly generates two integers, asks the user a question in the form of "What is the sum of these two integers?", 
and alerts the user if their answer is correct or incorrect.  It also keeps a running total of the scores, and shows
the user the total consecutive correct answers as well.  Each correct guess increases the maximum upper range of the randomly 
generated numbers by 1 until the user makes an incorrect guess, at which point the maximum becomes 10.  The minimum is always 1.

In order to start the app, simply open index.html with a live server in VSCode.  The extension `Live Server` is very useful
for this.  Simply right click `index.html` and choose `Open with Live Server`.
